<h5>Data Analytics Platform, January 2017 - Present</h5>

<p>I work on an application which provides views and reports of trader positions, such as daily balance sheets, attribution data, and sources and uses information. The data is housed in a database, is loaded into our Java-based Apache Spark application, and then retrieved via Spark SQL.</p>

<h6>Key Accomplishments</h6>

<ul>
<li>Performed and managed platform upgrade from Spark 1.6 to Spark 2.1 ensuring continuity of use and no unexpected change in behavior</li>
<li>On-going stabilization and productionizing of application, including automating releases and restarts and implementing application monitoring and alerting</li>

<h5>Real-time Messaging System, May 2016 - January 2017</h5>

<p>To meet a new application requirement, I designed, implemented, and deployed a real-time, rules-driven messaging system based on JMS, Drools, and MongoDB. Users can subscribe to chat, email, or web-based alerts for various events (i.e., corporate actions, large account changes, etc.)</p>

<h6>Key Accomplishments</h6>

<ul>
<li>Drove the project through the entire software development lifecycle from requirements gathering to production release</li>
<li>Performed proofs-of-concept for several new technologies and programming approaches which allowed the project to be a standard for future applications, including functional programming, more advanced use of Spring, and new approaches to automating deployment</li>
</ul>

<h5>Global Real-Time Position Keepers, April 2012 - May 2016</h5>

<p>I have worked on two position-keeping projects. These provide a real-time in-memory record of the bank&#8217;s current inventory. Positions are gathered from various upstream sources via SQL, file processing, messages (IBM MQ), and REST queries to other applications. After normalizing the positions, they are made available for querying and real-time calculations. The first was based on Java and Coherence, and the second was built with Java and GemFire, as well as a front-end built using C# .NET that deployed to a user&#8217;s machine for a customizable interface to the position keeping system.</p>

<h6>Key Accomplishments</h6>

<ul>
<li>Oversaw and was the key developer on the move to production for the 2.0 version of the application, which included ensuring continuity for existing users, on-boarding new users, adapting software to production query loads, and globalization of the application</li>
<li>Maintained, expanded, and improved RESTful web services, core storage and query functionality, test infrastructure, and data sources</li>
<li>Managed another developer while we implemented fixes and features for .NET UI</li>
<li>Worked on the development of a calculation layer, which did pre-defined calculations on inventory in real-time</li>
<li>Provided senior technical guidance for global project teams, participated in architectural discussions and decisions, and acted as a key technical advisor</li>
</ul>
